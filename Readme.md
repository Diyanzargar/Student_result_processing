# Student Result Processing System (Enterprise Edition)

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive, industry-level SQL database system designed for higher education institutions. It goes beyond simple grade recording to manage the entire academic lifecycle, including Faculty assignments, granular Assessment tracking (Quizzes, Midterms, Finals), and automated grading logic.

## Key Features
- **Granular Assessment System**: Tracks individual scores for Quizzes, Assignments, Midterms, and Finals.
- **Automated Grading Engine**:
    - **Trigger 1**: Calculates `Total Score` and `Grade` (A, B, etc.) automatically when assessment scores are entered.
    - **Trigger 2**: Updates the student's `CGPA` automatically when a course grade changes.
- **Faculty Management**: Links professors to courses and semesters.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Provides detailed transcripts and course performance metrics.

## Database Structure
- **People**: `Students`, `Faculty`
- **Academics**: `Departments`, `Semesters`, `Courses`
- **Assignments**: `Course_Assignments` (Faculty -> Course)
- **Grading**:
    - `Assessments` (Defining the tests)
    - `Student_Scores` (The actual marks)
    - `Enrollments` (The final course grade)

## How to Run
1.  **Schema**: Run `schema.sql` to create the tables.
2.  **Logic**: Run `logic.sql` to install the automation triggers.
3.  **Data**: Run `seed.sql` (generated by `generate_seed_data.py`) to populate the system with massive test data.
4.  **Analysis**: Run `queries.sql` to view reports.

## Automation Flow
1.  Insert a score into `Student_Scores`.
2.  `update_enrollment_score_trigger` fires -> Recalculates `Enrollments.total_score` & `grade_points`.
3.  `update_cgpa_after_grade_change` fires -> Recalculates `Students.current_cgpa`.
