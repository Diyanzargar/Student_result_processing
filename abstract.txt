Abstract

This project presents the design and implementation of a Student Result Processing System using SQL. The primary objective is to develop an efficient, scalable, and reliable database backend for managing academic results. The system features a normalized schema comprising tables for Students, Departments, Courses, Semesters, and Enrollments. It incorporates industry-standard database practices, including the use of Triggers for real-time CGPA updates and Window Functions for generating dynamic rank lists. The result is a comprehensive system capable of handling complex academic data processing tasks, ensuring data integrity, and providing valuable insights through analytical queries. This database serves as a foundational model for any educational institution looking to digitize their examination and grading workflows.
